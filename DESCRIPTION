Title: Simultaneous Confidence Bands for Functional Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Fabian J.E. Telschow

Description: This package implements methods for Simultaneous Inference
    for Random Fields (SIRF).
    Currently, the main functionality is computation of simultaneous confidence
    bands for the population mean or moment based statistics of differentiable
    random field data over a rectangular domain in 1D or 2D.
    Options to estimate the quantile are a non-parametric bootstrap,
    a multiplier bootstrap or the GKF. The latter is the main novelty since
    it allows for fast computation of the quantiles even for higher dimensional
    domains.
